# dyslexic-character-recognition

In this paper, we implement a CNN model to recognize and rectify incorrectly written 
characters, in order to aid children with dysgraphia as a result of dyslexia. Dysgraphia is a 
language disorder that is defined as a difficulty or inability to coherently communicate 
through writing. Children suffering from dyslexia often also suffer from dysgraphia and other 
language learning disabilities. The proposed work attempts to implement a CNN 
classification model that categorizes a character as correctly written or incorrectly written, 
and if it is incorrectly written, identifies the character it was supposed to be. Between 10% 
and 30% of children experience difficulty in writing, although the exact prevalence depends 
on the definition of dysgraphia. Our goal is to aid children with writing difficulties to practice 
their writing with the model helping them correct their mistakes. We emphasize on children 
and dyslexia as the training dataset we use contains characters written by dyslexic children.
Compared to the conventional testing procedures that take in a lot of time in screening, an 
automated detection mechanism would take lesser time and produce reliable results while 
analyzing the writing aspect.
